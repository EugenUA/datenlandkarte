Release:    v2

Changeset
---------

The new rewrite release addresses the following features:

* Complete new source code design

    * More scalability for base maps
    * Object-oriented software design
    * High distance between user interface and data processing
      (enabling simple change in web interface)

* More flexibility in terms of map aggregation [colors!]
  (as suggested ToDoWiki at Github)
* Relicensing to LGPLv3 (as decided by core-team)
* Slight improvements in web design and usability

Implemented recommendations
---------------------------

* manually define scales
* new scale showing changes in %, plus and minus
* make manual data input more usable
* add link to json-txt-download on input.php after creation of map
* link on /rohdaten to re-visualize raw data with API
* upload-function for adding new svg templates
* dynamic colors for title/labels... according to color palette
* reverse scales

Some rejected/open issues
-------------------------

* write guideline for creating SVG-templates
  Note: Not part of programmer's work
* Google Chart API binding
  Note: Sorry, simply not enough time for it.
* implement jquery-grid for display of json-arrays on raw data page 
  Note: Can be integrated with little effort. But not part of rewrite release.
* add tooltipps for SVGs: weitere Texte automatisch zu ergänzen
  Note: Nice idea. But I prefer a focus on pre-processing SVGs in this release.
* RDF als "Eingabeformat"
  Note: As far as I can see, RDF would be just JSON in XML. Easy to extend to
        this format. Can somebody write a specification for the RDF input?
* Raphael-Integration für interaktive Widgets
  Note: Please more information. What do you want to do with it?
* Bestehende OpenSource-Lösungen berücksichtigen wie zB Mapserver
  Note: We are a damn small subset of this solution. Interfacing the whole
        feature set of Mapserver is out of time & effort possibilities for me.
* Language support
  Note: Sorry, but current state sucks. However. Each HTML website has to be
        translated manually, which is not part of this release.


Best regards,
dev Lukas
